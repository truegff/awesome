This file was created by IntelliJ IDEA 10.5.2 for binding GitHub repository

This repo is a JackH79's .dotfiles (84376952260f4610cd857d8eee54fff1c4f27c22) awesome part clone,
with few modifications to make it work with awesome 3.4.11-2 from AUR:

1. get rid of shifty, because I didn't get what advantage it brings.
2. replaced all ***=wibox.widget.textbox() with ***=widget({type="textbox"})
3. obviously will add few widgets to my taste
4. used menu from terceiro's awesome-freedesktop repo. https://github.com/terceiro/awesome-freedesktop
5. modified mpdwidget to make it never hide. changed mouse key binding from 2 to 3 to run ncmpcpp
6. added keyboard layout changer to top right widget bar + key binding for it (Alt + Shift_L)
